# Rough ideas

## Feature Ideas

- **Search**: Search for candidates by skills, experience, location, etc.
- **Filters**: Filter candidates by skills, experience, location, availability, etc.
- **Saved Searches**: Save search queries for quick access later.
- **Profile Viewing**: View detailed professional profiles.
- **Collection**: Save candidates for future reference.
- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates.
- **Pagination / Infinite Scroll**: Navigate large result sets efficiently.
- **Real-time Availability**: Show candidates' availability in real-time.
- **Notifications**: Notify users about new candidates matching their criteria.
- **Analytics**: Track user interactions, search queries, and profile views for insights.
- **Integration**: Integrate with other HR tools or platforms for seamless data exchange.
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is usable on mobile devices.

## Stack

- Next.js
- Node.js (Express or Hono) / Next.js API routes (Node.js >>> Next.js - in case we need to scale the backend separately for expose the API for companies to integrate)
- MongoDB (Atlas Search)
- Redis (for caching)
- Auth.js / Better Auth / Clerk / Kinde (for authentication)
  - Auth.js is a good option for Next.js, but it's time consuming and can surely have some common pitfalls.
  - Clerk is a good option for authentication and user management. But it is a paid service and Vendor Lock-in.
  - Kinde is a custom setup but it's not big community yet.
  - Better Auth is built on top of Auth.js but too early
- AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 (for object storage)

## DB Models & Indexes

- **User**: { \_id, name, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at }
- **Profile**: { \_id, user_id, skills, experience, location, availability, created_at, updated_at }
- **SearchHistory**: { \_id, user_id, query, created_at }
- **SavedSearches**: { \_id, user_id, search_criteria, created_at }
- **Indexes**:
  - User: { email (unique), role }
  - Profile: { user_id, skills, experience, location, availability }
  - SearchHistory: { user_id, query, created_at }
  - SavedSearches: { user_id, search_criteria, created_at }
- **Date Versioning and Schema Evolution**:
  - Use MongoDB's built-in schema validation to enforce schema changes.
  - Use LiquidBase or Flyway to version the schema and handle migrations.

## Querying & Aggregation

- 1.  Profiles with a minimum number of years in a specific skill: `{ "skills": { $elemMatch: { name: "React", experience: { $gte: 3 } } } }`
- 2.  Candidates available within a date range: `{ "availability": { $gte: ISODate("2023-10-01"), $lte: ISODate("2023-10-31") } }`
- 3.  Profiles near a geographic location with fuzzy skill matching:

```json
{ "location": { $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [longitude, latitude] }, $maxDistance: 10000 } }, "skills": { $regex: "React", $options: "i" } }
```


## Search & Ranking Logic

### Search Functionality
- MongoDB Atlas Search with analyzers.
- Autocomplete, typo-tolerance using fuzzy search.

### Ranking Algorithm
- Skill match percentage (50%) - how well the skills match the search criteria.
- Years of experience (30%) - how many years of experience the candidate has in the relevant skills.
- Recency of activity (20%) - how recently the candidate has updated their profile or been active.

```
Score = Skill Match (%) * 0.5 + Years of Experience * 0.3 + Recency of Activity * 0.2
```


## API Design & Security
- **REST API**:
  - `GET /api/profiles`: Search profiles with filters.
  - `GET /api/profiles/:id`: View a specific profile.
  - `POST /api/profiles`: Create or update a profile.
  - `POST /api/saved-searches`: Save a search query.
  - `GET /api/saved-searches`: Retrieve saved searches.
  - `DELETE /api/saved-searches/:id`: Delete a saved search.

- **Authentication**:
  - Use JWT for stateless authentication.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (recruiters, hiring managers, candidates).
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- **CORS**: Configure CORS to allow requests from trusted domains only.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables.
- **Logging**: Implement logging for API requests and errors for monitoring and debugging.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus or Grafana for monitoring API performance and health.
- **Error Handling**: Implement a consistent error handling strategy for API responses.


## Frontend UI/UX Considerations
- **Search Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive search interface with filters and search bar.
- **UX Patterns**: Use tags for skills, filters for experience and location, and highlight search terms in results.
- **Profile View**: Display detailed information about candidates with sections for skills, experience, and availability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and responsive.
- **Accessibility**: Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the application is usable by all users.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use lazy loading for images and components, and optimize API calls to reduce load times.
- **User Feedback**: Provide feedback on actions (e.g., loading spinners, success/error messages).
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests for critical components and user flows.


## Extensibility
- **Microservices**: Consider breaking down the application into microservices for scalability and maintainability.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Design the system to allow for future plugins or integrations with other tools (e.g., ATS systems, CRM tools).
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable or disable features without deploying new code.
- **Implementation of Multi Tenancy**: Design the system to support multiple tenants (companies) with separate data and configurations.
